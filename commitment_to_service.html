            <h2>Security and Trust</h2>
            <p class="highlight">All payments are securely processed via invoices with enterprise-level encryption. Keys and passwords are stored securely in our safes, with encrypted codes corresponding to each key so no keys are labeled with the client name or address. This adds an extra layer of protection.</p>
            <p>Our business is only owner-operated, meaning we are the ones taking care of your home, not an employee. We have background-checked ourselves via a third party and are licensed by the state of Florida to conduct business. We carry over $1 million in liability insurance.</p>
            <p>We put your home and our business first, with no substitutions. Your home, and your satisfaction are our business. Details matter to us.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Consultation and Agreement</h2>
            <p>We offer a free 15-minute consultation where we can answer your questions. If we are both a good fit, we can create a personalized plan that includes our standard 31 checks plus any specifics you require for a small additional fee in some cases.</p>
            <p>We will be thorough, which is why we have a startup fee. We will need your lawn care and any cleaning or other services providers' contact information in case of emergencies. We can be there while you can't, but we need their info. We also have both us and you sign a small contract establishing our agreement. This is protection for each of us, and we also like to introduce ourselves to neighbors so they know we are supposed to be there and likely no one else. We are a team-oriented approach.</p>
        </section>
